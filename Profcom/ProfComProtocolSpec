ProfCom is a communication protocol used to relay important messages back 
to a central command. According to our intel ProfCom Servers operate on
port 8080 to try and mask the identity of the application. We planted
spyware on a ProfCom users computer and retreived an important asset that
should be useful to us. We were able to retreive the ProfComClient application
off of their computer. We have a basic understanding of how this protocol works,
that information is what follows these instructions.

Client -> Server

	Login Process:

		Integer Length of Username
		Char Username
		Integer Length of Password
		Char Password

Server -> Client

	Login Process:

		Boolean Password Accept/Rejected 

If authentication fails login process is reinitiated by the client.

Client -> Server

	Data Exchange:

		Integer Number of Messages to Send
		Integer Length of Message
		Char Data

After this message the client and server will disconnect

Question 5:

	How many messages were sent by the 2nd user that successfully authenticated?

Question 6:
